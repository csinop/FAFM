# FAFM is a Planner for Bodybuilding
     The app has several different fitness moves, more can be added without any trouble. 
# With FAFM:
     You can create, manage, and share a weekly fitness program.
     You can customize every move in terms of set and repetition count.
     
# How to use:
     If you are launching the app for the first time, you will be asked to create a profile. My intention is to make profile creation entirely optional but for the sake of making development easy, currently you have to create a profile. The information you enter regarding your name (username), weight, height, age, and gender will be encrypted.
     In order to create a weekly plan:
          1. Click on any weekday on the calendar tab.
          2. You will now see an activity where a plan for that day can be selected.
               2.1. Once you have created your plan just click "save changes" button and return to the main menu.
               2.2. Your plan for that day is now saved.
               2.3. You can repeat this process for each day of the week.
               2.4. If you do not set a plan for a day, that day will be displayed as your "off day" by default.
          3. After a weekly plan is set, you can select moves for each body part. You can do this by clicking to the "Moves" tab on the top bar.
               3.1. Here you can select which body part you would like to select moves for.

                    3.2.2. Once you check any box for a move you will be shown an input field, from which you can set repetition and set counts.
                    3.2.3. After you are done with your input, just click the "add" button and that move will be added.
                    3.2.4. After you have added every move you want, click the "save info" button and your changes will be saved.
               3.3. You can repeat step 3.2. for any body part or the cardio section.
          4. Now that you have a weekly plan, today's workout will be displayed in the main menu under "Today's Workout" text.
               3.1. Upon clicking "Today's Workout" you will be directed into a new activity in which you can view that day's workout in full detail.
